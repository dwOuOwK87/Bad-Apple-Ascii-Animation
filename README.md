## Bad-Apple-Ascii-Animation

**Tips**
>Clicking "start.py" can start the animation.  
>The program will ask you the scale of ASCII animation.  
>I recommend you to set it less than 100 both width and height with the same ratio as the original video.

**Need python3 and opencv**
>Install opencv: pip install opencv-python
