## Bad-Apple-Ascii-Animation

Click start.py to start animation.  
Program will ask you the scale of ASCII animation.  
I recommend you not to set it higher than 100 both width and height, and set to the same ratio as the original video. 

**Need python3 and opencv**
>Install opencv: pip install opencv-python
