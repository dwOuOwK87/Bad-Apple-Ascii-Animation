## Bad-Apple-Ascii-Animation

Click "start.py" to start the animation.

The program will ask you the scale of ASCII animation.  
I recommend you not to set it higher than 100 both width and height, and set to the same ratio as the original video. 

**Need python3 and opencv**
>Install opencv: pip install opencv-python

~~I'm bad on exception handling so it might looks kinda ugly or something...you know.~~
